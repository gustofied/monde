I just imagine a three-four-minute video: an agent, a submarine, 
something floating—not floating but underwater—a fish, whatever—an agent moving around 
in this immersive world trying to find targets, and it's been generated, curriculum learning or whatever, 
in the latent space. I'm just throwing out some names or wordings or keywords here, but some slop, you could say. 
But yeah, and then you have this song in the background, maybe as a rerun, maybe up some statistics, 
maybe have some analysis while you, some metrics while you see the boats. It will be amazing. 
I think that will be a heavy-hitter, heavy-hitter video.

With this song, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgeIDnLg0Ps&list=RDjgpW-_PjBbs&index=6
